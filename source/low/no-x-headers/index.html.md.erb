# Headers should not use the X- prefix


## Description
X- was originally used as a prefix for experimental HTTP headers, however it led to unstandardised headers being used in production. Therefore [rfc6648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6648) deprecates this convention.

## Example
The following is an example of how this might look in your OpenAPI document:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
paths:
  "/ping":
    get:
      parameters:
        - in: header
          name: X-Request-ID
          schema:
            type: string
```

## Remediation
The following is how the request header would look without the `X-` prefix:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
paths:
  /ping:
    get:
      summary: Checks if the server is alive
      parameters:
        - in: header
          name: Request-ID
          schema:
            type: string
```
