# Contact email or url is required


## Description
 The info object must contain either a contact email or contact url. A contact email or url allows people to contact the maintainers of the API and is useful for cataloguing purposes. The [gov.uk API standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards) recommends putting your API on the cross-government API catalogue, and contact is one of the required fields in our [proposed metadata model](https://github.com/co-cddo/federated-api-model/blob/main/schemas/v1alpha/api-metadata.json) for the catalogue. Having the contact field present could also be helpful in generating catalogue entries from OpenAPI documents in the future.

## Example
The following is an example of how your OpenAPI document might look if it's missing contact information:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
paths: {}
```

## Remediation
The following is an example of an OpenAPI document with contact information included:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
  contact: {
    "name": "API Support",
    "url": "https://www.example.com/support",
    "email": "support@example.com"
  }
paths: {}
```
