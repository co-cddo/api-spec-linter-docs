# Domain name characters


## Description
The [guidance on gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-an-api-domain-on-govuk) specifies that an API domain name must contain only alphanumeric characters (0-9 and a-z) and the ‘-’ (dash) symbol.

## Example
The following is an example of a domain name which would fail this rule because it contains an invalid character:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
paths: {}
servers:
  - url: 'https://vehicle-registration-number-*.api.gov.uk'
```

## Remediation
The following is an example of a valid domain name:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
paths: {}
servers:
  - url: 'https://vehicle-registration-number.api.gov.uk'
```
