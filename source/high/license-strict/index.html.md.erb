# License must be Apache 2.0

## Description
The license should be the Apache 2.0 license, a popular open source license.

## Example
The following is an example of an OpenAPI document which is referencing a closed source license type:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
  license:
    name: EULA
    identifier: EULA
paths: {}
```


## Remediation
The following is an example of an OpenAPI document which uses the correct license type:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
  license:
    name: Apache 2.0
    identifier: Apache-2.0
paths: {}
```
