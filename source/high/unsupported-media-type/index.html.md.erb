# HTTP 415 Unsupported media type

## Description
A 415 Unsupported Media Type error is returned when the consumer makes a request with a payload in a format that is not supported by the provider. Declaring a 415 as a response makes it clear to the consumer why their request failed. PUT, POST and PATCH operations should all declare a 415 as a response.

## Example
The following is an example of how an operation missing a 415 response might look:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
paths:
  "/":
    post:
      responses:
        '200': {}
```


## Remediation
The following is how an example of how an operation that does declare a 415 response:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
paths:
  "/":
    post:
      responses:
        '415': {}
```
