# HTTP 415 Unsupported media type

## Description
A 406 Not Acceptable error is returned when the consumer makes a request with a value in a content negotiation header that the producer can't handle. For example the consumer might request a version, a media type or a language etc. that the producer does not support. Declaring a 406 as a response makes it clear to the consumer why their request failed.

## Example
The following is an example of how an operation missing a 406 response might look:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
paths:
  "/":
    post:
      responses:
        '200': {}
```


## Remediation
The following is how an example of how an operation that does declare a 415 response:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
paths:
  "/":
    post:
      responses:
        '406': {}
```
