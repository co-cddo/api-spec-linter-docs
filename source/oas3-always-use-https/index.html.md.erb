# Servers must use the HTTPS protocol


## Description
Use of HTTPS is recommended in the [API guidance on gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards#use-https).

## Example
The following is an example of how this type of risk could look in your API definition:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
  info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
  paths: {}
  servers:
    - url: http://api.example.com
```

## Possible exploit scenario
Many services collect personal information from users or present information to them which they then use to make important decisions.

Itâ€™s important that you build a service that does not allow this information to be intercepted or modified by malicious third parties as it travels over the internet.

This means you must make sure your service (including APIs) is only accessible through secure connections. For web-based services this means HTTPS only, with an HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) configuration as explained in this guide.

(HTTPS describes the use of TLS, a lower level protocol previously known as SSL, to secure HTTP requests.)


## Remediation
The following is how this should look in your API definition:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
  info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
  paths: {}
  servers:
    - url: https://api.example.com
```
