title: Operation ID
---

# OperationID should be present for every endpoint

## Description
The operationID is a Unique string used to identify the operation. The id MUST be unique among all operations described in the API.
Every endpoint must have an operationId specified.

The operationId will be used to name methods in the API clients. As such, changes to the names should be treated as breaking changes, and so we should be careful and explicit with our naming of them

This ID will become the method name in the SDK.

note: The operationId value is case-sensitive. Tools and libraries MAY use the operationId to uniquely identify an operation, therefore, it is RECOMMENDED to follow common programming naming conventions.

## Example
The following is an example of an OpenAPI document which defines an operation that is missing an operationId:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
paths:
  /ping:
    get:
      summary: Checks if the server is alive
```


## Remediation
The following is an example of an OpenAPI document which defines an operation that does have an operationId:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
paths:
  /ping:
    get:
      summary: Checks if the server is alive
      operationId: ping
```
