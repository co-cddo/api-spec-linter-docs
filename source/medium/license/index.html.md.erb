# License must be open source

## Description
The license should be a popular open source licence, for example one of the popular licenses [listed on the opensource site](https://opensource.org/licenses/?categories=popular-strong-community).

## Example
The following is an example of an OpenAPI document which is referencing a closed source license type:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
  license:
    name: EULA
    identifier: EULA
paths: {}
```


## Remediation
The following is an example of an OpenAPI document which uses one of the popular licenses listed on the opensource site:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
  license:
    name: Apache 2.0
    identifier: Apache-2.0
paths: {}
```
