title: Kebab case for paths

# Paths should use kebab case

## Description
It is best practice to use kebab case (words separated by a hyphen) for URL names, rather than other cases such as camel case or snake case.

## Example
The following is an example of an OpenAPI document which has a path name that does not use kebab case:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
paths:
  /path-parameter:
    get:
      summary: Checks if the server is alive
      operationId: ping
```


## Remediation
The following is an example of an OpenAPI document which has a path name that does use kebab case:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: ''
  version: '1.0.0'
paths:
  /path-parameter:
    get:
      summary: Checks if the server is alive
      operationId: ping
```
